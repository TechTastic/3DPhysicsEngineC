Inspired by Valkyrien SKies 2, I have decided to try my hand at creating my own physics engine in C!

Of course, this is a cardinal sin, being my second time ever to touch C and being piss poor at math in general, but still!

Useage (Temp):
In the repository's root directory
```
./build.sh
./build/main.exe
```
